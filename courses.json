In this course, we'll look at a specific implementation that uses RabbitMQ as a Message Broker to better understand the pros and cons of various alternatives, including but not limited to whether or not you need to use messaging at all to solve such a problem. We'll touch upon Kafka a tiny, tiny bit but keep our focus primarily to Messaging Architecture in general, and RabbitMQ as a broker in particular. By the end of this course, you should be in a position to tell when you need to use a Message Broker, which one you may want to use, and how you should go about using it. While what we'll look at is a Ruby Microservice implementation, the learning would be just as applicable to other brokers and other languages."

While nothing is etched in stone and things are always subject to change, there are certain aspects of Software Architecture that, if you are not careful about, will be rather costly to make alterations to, and Multi Tenancy is definitely one of them. So, we explored several different options before arriving at the one we ended up implementing. When it comes to multi tenancy, there's at least 4 options available, and which one you should ideally go with depends on a variety of factors. In this course, we are going to take a deeper look at each of these 4 architectures and review their pros and cons.
